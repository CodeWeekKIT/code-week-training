Rails Girls Training Material
======================

This is the course material for Rails Girls Auckland.

Rails Girls Auckland is running an experimental version of the Rails Girls curriculum. Rather than spending hours setting up local installations, Rails Girls Auckland students will be using Nitrous.io, enabling them to jump straight into coding.

This material outlines the curriculum for that, and also incorporates some of the "Guide to the Guide", to provide more explanations for what the students are doing, when they are doing it.

You can [access the material here](http://railsgirlsauckland.github.io/railsgirlspresentation).
